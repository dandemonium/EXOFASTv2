; NAME:
;   GETBURNNDX
; PURPOSE:
;   Returns the index of the first useable link in a Markov chain.
;
; DESCRIPTION: 
;   Determines the point at which all chains have had at least one
;   chi^2 lower than the median chi^2 of the best chain. If some
;   chains never reach this point or reach this point very late, they
;   are ignored in the calculation.
;   
;   nsteps*0.1 <= burnndx <= nsteps*0.9
; 
;   That is...
;
;   It will always discard at least 10% of the steps in case the
;   initialization of the chains is insufficiently scattered around
;   the best fit, which would bias the results toward the starting
;   value.
; 
;   It will never discard more than 90% of the steps to enable the
;   robust calculation of mixing criteria.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE: 
;   burnndx = getburnndx(chi2 [,GOODCHAINS=,BADCHAINS=])
;
; INPUTS:
;   
;   CHI2 - An NSTEPS x NCHAINS array of chi2 values
; 
; OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
; 
;   GOODCHAINS - An array of indices of chains that are good, meaning
;                they have at least one point below the median of the
;                best chain.  
;   BADCHAINS  - An array of indices of chains that are bad, meaning
;                their chi2 is never below the median of the best
;                chain
;
;   MEDCHI2    - The median chi2 of the best chain
;
; REVISION HISTORY:
;   2018/03 - Written -- Jason Eastman (CfA)
;   2018/04 - Modified goodchains to maximize the total number of
;             saved links
